the philosophers can be at one of three states
    eating, thinking, sleeping

a philosopher needs two forks to eat
    one to its right and the one to its left

when a philosopher is finished eating **they realease the forks** and start to think
    when finished thinking, they start to sleep
    when finished sleeping, they start eating again
the simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation

every philo should eat and not die of starvation
